The device only has the category 'sleeping', there is no light/deep sleep
Deep sleep is characterized by prolonged periods of 0 intensity.
It seems that after +/- 10 minutes of 0 intensity deep sleep kicks in and you
go back to light sleep if intensity goes up again to > 15.
After some sleep (112) states a SleepStart (123) is usually present but not always.
Sleep is ended by WakeUp (28) but not always....

112 with intensity =0 means not worn.
112 with intensity >0 means light sleep.

105 -> wake up (sleep interrupt)
106 -> fall asleep

So when you are inactive, you are given the value "81".
If the value "81" is with a raw intensity of <3 for ten times, this triggers 91. -> You fell asleep.
-> Those 10x 81 are then interpreted as Light sleep
(as those values cant be changed anymore, but mean that you were sleeping at that point)
-> So a 91 basically means: You had light sleep the 10 minutes before.

From this point on everything is recorded as 112. Now we are in a deep sleep phase.
Why? Because from here I had only 112s with raw intensity of 0!
I figured out the threshold: If you have 8 times (or 8 minutes) 112s with 0 intensity,
you are now in deep sleep. (we start counting deepslep from the 8th 112 with 0 intensity)

So when do I switch back to light sleep? Easy! We have a 112 with increased intensity!
For me the lowest value was intensity 6 to wake up. So lets asume intensity >5 112
means you switched from deep, to light sleep.


type 81: "inactive"
type 91: "inactive for too long, Roxxor91 started sleeping 10 minutes ago"
type 112: "sleeping"
type 112 with intensity "0" for 8 minutes: "deep sleep begins (now)"
type 112 with intensity >5: "deep sleep ended"
type 28: "out of bed"

Let's say: type 28 and 105: "woke up"
